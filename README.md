A Google Assistant Skill that aids in every aspect of cooking

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trevorforrey/SousChef.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trevorforrey/SousChef)

* First steps to take in demoing the Web App is to say (type) lets get cooking, the app will ask who its talking to and you can type the username "thetoastyone" and it'll ask what you'd like to cook, that user has both "Bread and butter" and "Grilled cheese" recipes in their account.

* On both you can login as the user _thetoastyone_ with the password of _toast_
On the google assistant side, you can choose to cook the recipe _Bread and Butter_ or _Grilled Cheese_ 

* For the website you can use the username and password above, or create your own user under register.  You can upload a recipe, or view your "cookbook" as well.  Sprint 2 was all about functionality, so the design is not great, but thats coming in Sprint 3.
